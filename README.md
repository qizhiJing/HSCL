# Hierarchical-Alignment-for-Multi-modal-Representation-Learning-in-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Diagnosis
Alzheimerâ€™s disease diagnosis increasingly relies on multi-modal data, including neuroimaging and specific proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, effective representation learning that captures the discriminative characteristics of multi-modal data remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical alignment method based on supervised contrastive learning to optimize representation distribution through enhanced intra-modal and inter-modal alignment. Specifically, our method ensures that features within each modality are tightly clustered by class, thereby achieving intra-modal alignment. It then aligns features across modalities in a common space, ensuring consistency between the representations of the same class for inter-modal alignment. Furthermore, a curriculum learning strategy is employed that first focuses on intra-modal alignment and then gradually transitions to inter-modal alignment, fostering a well-structured feature space. Experimental results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method,outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches with accuracy of 96.74%.
